# Releasing cognitive-java

This runbook covers normal releases from `main` and isolated patch releases
from single-segment `release/hotfix/<slug>` branches. A release is complete
only when Maven Central, the Gradle Plugin Portal, the signed GitHub assets,
and GitHub attestations are all public and verified.

## Access and prerequisites

The releaser needs repository-owner access and GitHub CLI authentication for
preparation and recovery work. CI owns the private signing key whose
fingerprint is `E6BB1FB6EE83EEAB7B408C6B5CA409BD8EE61724`; maintainers do not need to
unlock the key, create a tag, or approve a deployment locally.

The `release` environment accepts deployments only from protected branches and
does not require a manual reviewer. The following Actions secrets deliberately
remain at repository scope as an accepted residual risk:

- `GRADLE_PUBLISH_KEY`
- `GRADLE_PUBLISH_SECRET`
- `MAVEN_CENTRAL_TOKEN_PASSWORD`
- `MAVEN_CENTRAL_TOKEN_USERNAME`
- `MAVEN_GPG_PASSPHRASE`
- `MAVEN_GPG_PRIVATE_KEY`

Only the environment-gated publish job may reference them. Never print or
include their values in issues, commits, artifacts, or logs. In particular,
never copy `MAVEN_GPG_PASSPHRASE` into command-line arguments or files; the
workflow supplies it to GPG through a private file descriptor. Existing
publishing-plugin credentials remain masked when their command interfaces
require workflow arguments.

Before preparing a release, confirm:

- all release prerequisites are merged and verified; the tracker remains open until publication;
- the worktree is clean and the release branch is synchronized with its remote;
- every change since the selected baseline is linked to release scope;
- `verify / required` is green on the source commit;
- the release version does not already exist in either registry, as a tag, or
  as a GitHub Release.

## Prepare through a pull request

Use one issue-linked release branch. Set the root Maven version, every module
parent/project version, and the Gradle project version to the exact release
version. Move `Unreleased` changelog entries under the version and actual date,
update current installation examples and release notes, and preserve old
versions only in historical or migration context.

Run the local gates supported by the current host:

```bash
VERSION=x.y.z # replace with the version being prepared
bash .github/scripts/verify-version-alignment.sh --expected-version "$VERSION"
mvn -B -ntp verify
mvn -B -ntp -P'!quality-gates-all,release' \
  -DskipTests -Dgpg.skip=true -Dcentral.skipPublishing=true verify
java .github/scripts/VerifyLegalContents.java
```

The pull request must close its issue, pass the full hosted compatibility and
reproducibility matrix, resolve every review conversation, and receive a fresh
Copilot review after its latest push. Merge only through a merge commit.

Merging that pull request is the irreversible release action. A protected-branch
push that changes the aligned project version from its first parent is treated
as an intentional release candidate. Ordinary merges that leave the version
unchanged finish the `Release` workflow as a successful no-op without accessing
publishing secrets.

## Normal release from main

1. Merge the reviewed release-preparation pull request into protected `main`.
2. Monitor both the merged commit's `verify / required` check and its `Release`
   workflow run.
3. The secret-free candidate job validates the stable version increase,
   aligned Maven and Gradle versions, dated changelog heading, protected source,
   and absence of release collisions. It waits for `verify / required` on the
   exact merge commit.
4. The environment-gated job imports the existing GitHub GPG secrets, verifies
   the private-key fingerprint, creates and verifies the immutable signed
   annotated tag, and pushes it with `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
5. The same run creates the draft GitHub Release, publishes both registries,
   uploads the signed bundle, verifies every target and attestation, and only
   then publishes the draft.

Do not create release tags manually. Tag pushes do not trigger publication,
and a tag already present on an initial workflow attempt is treated as an
interference failure.

## Isolated hotfix release

Use this path only when the patch must not include newer `main` work.

1. Create `release/hotfix/<slug>` from the latest stable tag. The protected
   branch history must contain that tag.
2. Land the minimal fix and patch-version preparation through reviewed PRs into
   that branch. The same `verify / required` policy applies.
3. Merge the patch-version preparation into the protected hotfix branch. That
   merge automatically signs the tag and publishes exactly as on `main`.
4. After publication, merge the hotfix branch back into `main` through a PR.
   Resolve conflicts without dropping the released fix or release history.
5. Delete the hotfix branch only after the merge-back is complete.

The source validator rejects unprotected hotfix branches and branches that do
not contain the preceding stable tag.

## Verify publication

The GitHub Release must be non-draft, marked latest when appropriate, and point
to the same commit as the signed tag. It must contain exactly the executable
CLI JAR, four CycloneDX JSON SBOMs, `SHA256SUMS`, `SHA512SUMS`, and a detached
`.asc` signature for each of those seven payload/manifest files.

Use [RELEASE-ARTIFACTS.md](RELEASE-ARTIFACTS.md) for checksums and signatures.
Download each main JAR from its published registry and verify its provenance
and SBOM attestation against the release commit, protected source branch, and
release workflow:

```bash
REPOSITORY=fabian-barney/cognitive-java
RELEASE_COMMIT=$(git rev-list -n 1 "v$VERSION")
SOURCE_BRANCH=main # use the protected hotfix branch for a hotfix release
SUBJECT=cognitive-java-core-$VERSION.jar # repeat for all four main JARs
gh attestation verify "$SUBJECT" --repo "$REPOSITORY" \
  --signer-workflow "$REPOSITORY/.github/workflows/release.yml" \
  --source-digest "$RELEASE_COMMIT" --signer-digest "$RELEASE_COMMIT" \
  --source-ref "refs/heads/$SOURCE_BRANCH" --deny-self-hosted-runners
gh attestation verify "$SUBJECT" --repo "$REPOSITORY" \
  --signer-workflow "$REPOSITORY/.github/workflows/release.yml" \
  --source-digest "$RELEASE_COMMIT" --signer-digest "$RELEASE_COMMIT" \
  --source-ref "refs/heads/$SOURCE_BRANCH" --deny-self-hosted-runners \
  --predicate-type https://cyclonedx.org/bom
```

The attested SBOM predicate must equal the corresponding signed GitHub SBOM.
The release workflow verifies that equality and compares all registry downloads
with the frozen, verified build payloads before making the GitHub release public.
Also verify all four artifact families on
Maven Central have main, sources, and Javadoc JARs plus PGP signatures:

- `media.barney:cognitive-java-core:VERSION`
- `media.barney:cognitive-java-cli:VERSION`
- `media.barney:cognitive-java-maven-plugin:VERSION`
- `media.barney:cognitive-java-gradle-plugin:VERSION`

Finally, open
`https://plugins.gradle.org/plugin/media.barney.cognitive-java/VERSION` and confirm
the version is available. Close the release issue and umbrella tracker only
after all checks pass.

## Failure recovery

- Before any target is public, leave the GitHub Release as a draft. For a
  transient service or credential failure, correct the external configuration
  and re-run the failed workflow jobs on the same commit. Do not create another
  trigger commit or tag.
- A rerun may reuse an existing tag only when it points to the exact release
  commit and has a valid signature from the committed public key. Any mismatch
  is a hard failure.
- Once any registry artifact or final GitHub release is public, a failed release burns
  that version. Preserve the signed tag, public bytes, and remaining draft. Record
  the failure and recover through the next patch version, even when retrying the
  same commit might otherwise look safe.
- For a partial v1.0.0 failure, prepare v1.0.1 through another reviewed version-bump
  PR. Never update or delete the v1.0.0 tag or replace its public artifacts.
- If verification cannot establish artifact, signature, attestation, registry,
  and tag identity, keep the GitHub Release in draft state and record the exact
  failing target on the release issue.
